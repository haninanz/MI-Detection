# MI-Detection

The main purpose of the model is to detect and classify Motor Imagery (MI) contained in one EEG epoch (epoch here referred to a shorter sequence of long EEG signals, not training iteration) using CNN without relying on existing EEG feature extraction tools. The open dataset used in this project is developed by Kaya et al. (2018).
